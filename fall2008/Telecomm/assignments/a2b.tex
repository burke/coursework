\begin{enumerate}
\item The propagation time can safely be ignored in most cases, as it's usually several orders of magnitude less than $t_{trans}$. Ex. On a 3km cable, $t_{trans}$ will be approximately $\frac{3000}{\frac{2}{3}*c}$ -- on the order of $10^{-5}$.

\item 
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{$N$}: The number of nodes
    \item \textbf{$p$}: The probability that any node will be transmitting at a given moment in time
    \item \textbf{$(1-p)^{N-1}$}: The probability all nodes other than the one wanting to transmit are silent at the moment of transmission
  \end{itemize}

\item 
  \begin{itemize}
    \item (See $N$, $p$, and $(1-p)^{N-1}$ above)
    \item \textbf{$(1-p)^{N}$}: The probability that no node wants to transmit at a given instant
  \end{itemize}
