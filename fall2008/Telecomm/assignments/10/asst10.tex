The md5 checksum of the executable produced by md5.c is \\
`\texttt{b0e9a6730f90a73be0b41978a92206a7}'. The md5sum can be used to verify that a file is identical to a previously verified version. 

After a minor modification to a comment in md5.c, the checksum of the compiled executable is still `\texttt{b0e9a6730f90a73be0b41978a92206a7}'. This makes sense, since a change in a comment should not affect the compiler output, so the generated program should be identical to the one from before -- at least, I can't think of any practical application of a non-deterministic compiler.
