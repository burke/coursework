1) (done) 
2) "MCU Port"
3) All three connectors marked "MCU Port" are connected (J5, J6, J7).
  3.1) This would allow for multiple devices that use independent subsets of connectors, or devices that operate periodically at different times.
4) Octal bus switch
  4.1) The chip allows the pushbutton and LED enable jumpers on JP10 to each enable 4 lines.
5) This is the feature enable jumper set. the jumpers enable the buzzer, LEDs, and Pushbuttons.
  5.1) A lot of projects will not make use of pushbuttons or LEDs, so it makes sense to disable them. Buzzers can be especially irritating :)
6) High.
  6.1) Low. This would just invert the function of the jumper.
7) Low.
8) Inverting resistors maybe? There's really no way to tell...
9) M36
10) PT5/IOC5
11) 8
  11.1) 4
  11.2) Some could be reserved for use outside the MCU.
12) M9, M11, M29, M31
13) PP5/KWP5, PE0/XIRQ, PAD02/AN02, PAD03/AN03
  13.1) Well, yes, I guess. They're all connected to the MCU port.
14) The line goes High when a button is depressed.
15) four
16) M39, M37, M35, M33
17) PAD07/AN07, PAD06/AN06, PAD05/AN05, PAD04/AN04
