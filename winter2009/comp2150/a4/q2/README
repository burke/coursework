Well, I didn't follow many of the assignment guidelines here, based on a fundamental objection to the way Anderson is telling us to do OO in ruby. The object hierarchy is beyond pointless with duck typing available... 

Anyway, I wrote the assignment the way I think it _should_ be done in ruby. It's probably not worth much given the marking scheme. Oh well.
