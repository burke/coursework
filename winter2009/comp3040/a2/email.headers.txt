Dear Board of Directors,

As you may know, I recently completed the first prototype of our new
BartenderInTheBox=E2=84=A2 product. We are quite confident that this produc=
t
will be ready for release very soon. I've attached a short report
covering implementation details for your consideration.

The current prototype contains a database of 30,000 mixed drinks and
12 reservoirs for ingredients. The user will fill each reservoir with
an ingredient, and input these selections into the software. The
software then calculates a list of the available drinks, considering a
drink "available" if every ingredient required to make it is present
in a reservoir. Once the user selects a drink, the required amount of
each ingredient is pumped into a glass. We are considering a magnetic
stirring apparatus for future versions, but it is beyond the scope of
the current prototype.

The attached report covers the high-level architecture of both the
software and hardware aspects of this project, going into finer detail
where appropriate.

Sincerely,

Burke Libbey
