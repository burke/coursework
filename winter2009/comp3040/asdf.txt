When a situation occurs where you need to replace a flat tire, the following steps will get you through your predicament:

If possible, position the car on as firm a surface as is available.

Ensure the engine is turned off.

Ensure the parking brake is engaged.

If the car has an automatic transmission, ensure the shift lever is placed in the "park" position.

If the car has a manual transmission, ensure the shift lever is placed in the "reverse" position.

Place a piece of wood beneath the wheel diagonally opposite to the wheel being replaced.

Remove the spare wheel, jack, and lug wrench from the luggage compartment.

You are now prepared to change the tire, please proceed with caution.
