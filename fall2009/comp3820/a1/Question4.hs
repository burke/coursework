{-|
  Convert a string of form "GATTACA" to a nucleotide sequence that Bio groks.
  The first argument to Seq is the sequence header. It doesn't seem to
  matter for the parts of the library I'm using, so default to "A".

toSeq x = Seq (B.pack $ map c2w "A") (B.pack $ map c2w x) Nothing

  This part is a bit hairy, I guess. 'global_align' returns (score, editList).
  We're only concerned with editList. We have to call toStrings on it first,
  to get the actual aligned sequences in a nice 2-tuple of strings.

                    Sequence Nuc -> Sequence Nuc -> (String, String)
alignedSequences substMx (sPen, lPen) seq1 seq2 =
    toStrings . snd $ global_align substMx (sPen, lPen) seq1 seq2

  What we're doing here is reading in the matrix and assuming it's of the form:
     |  A|  C|  G|  T
    A|  n|  n|  n|  n
    C|  n|  n|  n|  n
    G|  n|  n|  n|  n
    T|  n|  n|  n|  n
   Notably, the headers are totally ignored, and the order is treated as ACGT.
   We construct a function that returns the right value for a pair of
   nucleotides. This could be optimized and beautified a fair bit, but my
   haskell-fu is still weak.

          split    = splitRegex $ mkRegex " *\\| *"
          w2i = c2i . w2c
          c2i 'A' = 1
          c2i 'C' = 2
          c2i 'G' = 3
          c2i 'T' = 4

  1. Read the start and length penalties from stdin as integers, one per line.
  2. Read two sequences from stdin, one per line.
  3. Compute the optimal alignment, print the aligned sequences to stdout.

  This is really ugly. I should do something about this.
